# The Beginning of Everything

At the Beijing THO on November 8, 2025, I saw three stunning Touhou-themed famous painting parodies. After buying two of them, I was still amazed by the creativity and wanted more.

Taking action right away, I contacted the artist that night. With their permission, I obtained the original images and produced two Giclée prints. I believe such excellent artistic resources deserve to be presented on better media, such as high-quality photography cotton paper output by Epson 10-color printers.

Still not satisfied, I established the circle's name the next day, and on the third day, I bought the domain name and started building the circle's website.

Then came the process of finding suitable artists and commissioning new works.

It is now 0:22 on November 11th. From the moment I had the idea to create the circle to putting it into action, it took about 48 hours.

Plans for many more artistic resources have already formed in my mind. It seems this Double 11, my wallet is going to take a big hit.

Finally, congratulations on the founding of Sukima Moonlight. I hope that I, and my future partners, can maintain our drive, plan scientifically, develop for the long term, and achieve infinite progress.

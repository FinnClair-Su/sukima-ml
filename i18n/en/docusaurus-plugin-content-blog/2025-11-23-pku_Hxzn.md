# Fantasy Guide~

The Peking University (PKU) Touhou meeting on November 23, 2025, was the first offline debut of our circle's products.

For this occasion, we specially prepared two prints of Yukari-sama. According to the original script, the 16-inch print was for the lucky draw, while the 20-inch one was only for display. However, due to a failure to confirm details with the staff, something unexpected happened—the 20-inch masterpiece, which should have come home with me, was held high by Remilia on stage and given away as the grand prize to a lucky "villager."

What's done is done. To avoid disappointing everyone, I decided to "go with the flow" and gave the remaining 16-inch print to the hardworking staff members on site.

The promotion cost for this event completely exceeded the budget, but participating in a university meeting with such a great atmosphere was definitely worth it. Moreover, I had a burst of my own luck and won a second prize—Enjou Bookstore's "Human Village, Strolling in the Courtyard."
